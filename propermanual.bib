	abstract = {Operational research practitioners use mathematical, statistical, scientific, and other methods to structure and analyse issues in order to advise and assist their clients. In doing so they apply values, follow rules and use methodologies. The paper examines the justification of these methods, values and methodologies. Starting with a conceptual model drawn from the philosophy of science, a justification framework is developed for operational research (OR). Making a distinction between OR academic research and OR practice helps to clarify the issues. OR research is similar to scientific, mathematical and social science research; OR practice, as technology, is closer to engineering. While OR academic researchers will seek justification in the academic discipline within which they choose to work, it is argued that the justification of OR practice lies in its usefulness. For academic OR, justification lies in the justification of mathematics, statistics, science and social science; for practice, it is practitioners who decide what usefulness means in their context.},

	abstract = {Science always evolves, responding to its leading challenges as they change through history. After centuries of triumph and optimism, science is now called on to remedy the pathologies of the global industrial system of which it forms the basis. Whereas science was previously understood as steadily advancing in the certainty of our knowledge and control of the natural world, now science is seen as coping with many uncertainties in policy issues of risks and the environment. In response, new styles of scientific activity are being developed. The reductionist, analytical world-view which divides systems into ever smaller elements, studied by ever more esoteric specialties, is being replaced by a systemic, synthetic and humanistic approach. The old dichotomies of facts and values, and of knowledge and ignorance, are being transcended. Natural systems are recognized as dynamic and complex; those involving interactions with humanity are “emergent,” including properties of reflection and contradiction. The science appropriate to this new condition will be based on the assumptions of unpredictability, incomplete control, and a plurality of legitimate perspectives.},
